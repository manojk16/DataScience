# R Programming Language:
I studied  R Programming language from 26th March-19 to 07th April-19 to make myself one step ahead towards data science.
I am following and ***R Programming A-Zâ„¢: R For Data Science With Real Exercises!***  by Kirill Eremenko from Udemy and I am referring the source and data set provided by him,
Find out some of the  jupyter notebook which I develop during this course.If you find out some issue feel free to please file the issue.
Thanks

To Make the chart we have to have 3 building blocks and in total, we can have 7 blocks. Out of below seven blocks, the first 3 blocks are very Important.
1. Data: First Thing which we need to make the chart
2. Aesthetics: It is a way to translate the data into things which we can see 
3. Geometry: How we are representing the things/object into the charts. Like rectangle,triangle, circle,box etc.
4. Statistics: Transform the data into a new variable by grouping the data and other methods and then visualize
the data 
5. Facets: If some data is repeated after a fixed interval of time 
6. Coordinates: Which coordinates are used to visualize the data 
7. Theme: Theme like how the color is chosen, where is the legend, what are the main articles, text size, etc.
