# R Programming Language:
I started R Programming language on  26th March 2019 to make myself one step ahead towards data science.
I am following and ***R Programming A-Zâ„¢: R For Data Science With Real Exercises!***  by Kirill Eremenko from Udemy and I am referring the source and data set provided by him, 
To find out some jupyter notebook which I develop during this course. 
If you find any issue feel free to file it
Thanks  
## Jupyter Note-Books 
  
1. [Assignment_1.ipynb](#Assignment-1.ipynb)  
2. [Demographic_Data_Analysis.ipynb](#Demographic-Data-Analysis.ipynb)  
3. [Data_Visualization_qplot_in_R.ipynb](#Data-Visualization-qplot-in-R.ipynb)

To Make the chart we have to have 3 building blocks and in total, we can have 7 blocks. Out of below seven blocks, the first 3 blocks are very Important.
1. Data: First Thing which we need to make the chart
2. Aesthetics: It is a way to translate the data into things which we can see 
3. Geometry: How we are representing the things/object into the charts. Like rectangle,triangle, circle,box etc.
4. Statistics: Transform the data into a new variable by grouping the data and other methods and then visualize
the data 
5. Facets: If some data is repeated after a fixed interval of time 
6. Coordinates: Which coordinates are used to visualize the data 
7. Theme: Theme like how the color is chosen, where is the legend, what are the main articles, text size, etc.
